### ***DNI*** ++  
- basic [c](https://dni-criteria.carrd.co)riteria, the same as always. i am pretty tolerant of a lot of things but if you make me lose my patience or are just that annoying, i won't hesitate to block/hide!
- **MAJOR NONO's**: sexualizing me or my friends that i sit near, if you are a minor and you're on the 18+ server (hope you get your account banned! /silly).. please stop sayin u wish my cc's / kins would die, i am manifesting that your pillows are never cold.
- 🚫 I DONT ACCEPT FRIEND REQUESTS ON SAFE SERVER !! 🚫

### **INT** ++ 
- Ponies within the same [f](https://rentry.co/thoughtcrimes)andoms / [s](https://pronouns.cc/@nineteeneightyfour)ource as me (except for idv, thin ice)!! feel free to cuddle/boop/hide with my avi! i'm typically slow with replies, sorry in advance!!
- sorry in advance if i boop / kiss and it's against ur boundaries! i get very happy seeing others with my interests <3
- if it's urgent please whisper as i might be offtab!! crowns are always welcomed and i typically reply with a heart `<3` in case that makes you uncomfy!

### **BYI** ++ 
- i may cuddle with my friends but it doesn't *always* necessarily mean that i ship the characters or that i am in the same fandom!
- ***ALSO*** i don't do rp and i never take that stuff seriously! 
if you just start roleplaying out of nowhere, imma act goofy or not reciprocate like at all .. `changeling ponies` or anyone who plays some type of character on ponytown are so silly **but** exhausting for me to interact with so fair warning, i may ignore u. 
- **regarding skin copying/taking insp**: its funny when i see people copy or take inspo, i just screenshot yall and make fun of you with my friends lmaoo just don't do it :D
